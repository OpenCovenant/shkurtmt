## shkurtmt

Dataset that contains abbreviations used in the Albanian language. It's currently tailored for the
[**penda**](https://github.com/OpenCovenant/ink) project.

### Getting Started

The dataset is contained in a text file named [**shkurtmt.json**](shkurtmt.json). Every abbreviation can correspond to
many words, albeit usually just one. We are looking to improve the structure and format, and more importantly increase
the quality of these words.

### Contributors

The entries found in this dataset have been manually curated, even though there is still a very low number of them. We'd
like to express our gratitude in the following alphabetical list.

- AndiBraimllari (Andi Braimllari)
- KostaTB (Kostian Qirjazi)
